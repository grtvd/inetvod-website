<h2>iNetVOD Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Effective April 2, 2008</h3>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. This Policy applies to all
of the iNetVOD websites, such as StormMediaPlayer.com, StormMediaPlayer.net,
StormMediaPlayer.org, StormMP.com, StormMP.net, StormMP.org, iNetVOD.com,
iNetVOD.net, iNetVOD.org (“iNetVOD Sites”) and to related iNetVOD software
applications, such as Storm Media Player for Windows Media Center Edition,
collectively “iNetVOD Services”. “iNetVOD Services” are provided by iNetVOD,
Inc. (“iNetVOD”).</p>

<p>The iNetVOD Services and Sites are not intended for children
under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<h3>Information you provide</h3>

<p>When you register for an account on an iNetVOD Site, we ask
for your personal information (such as your name, email address and an account
password).  We also optionally allow you to provide your address and credit
card information.  iNetVOD uses your credit card information for enhanced
services, such as show rentals and purchases.  Upon your consent, your credit
card and other personal information is sent to an indentified third party for
fulfillment of a request initiated by you.  You are not required to provide
address or credit card information; however, as a result some services may be
unavailable to you.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are small bits of information placed on the hard
drive of your computer. The iNetVOD Sites use cookies to make your browsing
experience more enjoyable. Most cookies only exist for the current browser
session. Some cookies are permanently stored for easier account logon. Most
browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser
to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the
iNetVOD Sites require cookies to function.</p>

<h3>Log Information</h3>

<p>When you use iNetVOD Services, our servers automatically
record information that your browser sends whenever you visit an iNetVOD Site.
These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet
Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your
request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify you.</p>

<h3>User communications</h3>

<p>When you send email or other communication to iNetVOD, we
may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to
your requests and improve our services.</p>

<h3>Affiliated sites</h3>

<p>We offer some of our services in connection with other web
sites. iNetVOD is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Affiliated
Sites or other websites operated by third parties that are linked to any of the
iNetVOD Sites. You should check the privacy policy of the other web site to
determine how it handles any personally identifiable information they collect
from you.</p>

<h3>Changes to this policy</h3>

<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to
time.  Changes shall be effective upon posting the new Privacy Policy on any of
the iNetVOD Sites.</p>
