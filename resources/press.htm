<p><b>iNetVOD to offer Internet-based Video-on-Demand content on Microsoft Windows Media Center Edition</b><br>
<br>
Collegeville, PA, January 16, 2006/PRWeb/ -- iNetVOD, the Internet-based video-on-demand (VOD) software
company has developed an application for Windows Media Center Edition.  This exciting new application will
connect to the iNetVOD Service, giving greater access to Window Media Center enabled computers and TVs to
communicate directly with Internet-based VOD content providers through the computer or TV screen.  This enables
viewers to locate and access Internet-based VOD content from the comfort of their living rooms by simply using
their television remotes.<br>
<br>
The iNetVOD Service for Windows Media Center Edition will be strengthened with ongoing discussions taking place
with many network enabled media player device manufacturers that make networked DVD players, game consoles and
other devices.  Once completed, these devices will house iNetVOD’s software to enable delivery of the
Internet-based content.<br>
<br>
iNetVOD is also in discussions with many Internet-based content providers to allow their content to be made
available to TV viewers using the iNetVOD service.  The content providers will continue to have a direct
relationship with their customers and view iNetVOD as another important distribution channel.<br>
<br>
About iNetVOD
iNetVOD provides a video-on-demand open marketplace service for bringing together Internet-based VOD content
providers with network-enabled consumer electronic and media player devices that are attached to consumers'
television sets.  This would include devices such as networked DVD players, specialized media player devices,
gaming consoles, set-top boxes, personal computers, etc.  iNetVOD does not provide its own video-on-demand
content nor does it build or manufacture its own media player device.  Instead, iNetVOD has created an open
standard for connecting these existing media player devices with Internet-based video content.  This integration
helps consumers locate and access Internet-based VOD content using their television remotes.  More information
can be found at www.inetvod.com.
