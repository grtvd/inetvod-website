<p><b>iNetVOD Launches Beta of Storm Media Player at StormMP.com</b><br>
<br>
Collegeville, PA (PRWEB) July 23, 2008 -- iNetVOD today launched a beta version of its Storm Media Player website
(at StormMP.com), an Internet video site for accessing video and audio content from many different content providers
and content owners. The Storm website offers consumers a single, easy-to-use interface for managing their video and
audio consumption, regardless of where the content resides. All of the consumers' selected shows are stored in their
personal "My Shows" list. Anytime they return to the site, all of their shows are instantly available in a sortable,
filtered list. Of course, since Storm lives in the Internet cloud, their "My Shows" list is available anytime, on any
web-enabled device.<br>
<br>
The Storm website works on top of iNetVOD's Open Video Platform<font size="1">sm</font>. The Open Video
Platform<font size="1">sm</font> was created to enable access from many different types of media player devices through
its open player API. Shortly, iNetVOD will be freely publishing its player API, allowing anyone to build a player device
that works with the service.<br>
<br>
About iNetVOD<br>
iNetVOD has created its Open Video Platform<font size="1">sm</font> to provide an open video marketplace service for
bringing together a multitude of Internet-based video and audio content providers with many different types of media
player devices. Player devices such as personal computers (web-based, gadgets, widgets, etc.), gaming consoles, mobile
devices, networked DVD players, specialized media player devices, set-top boxes, etc. iNetVOD does not host its own
video or audio content nor does it manufacture its own devices. Instead, iNetVOD provides an open platform that allows
consumers to easily access a variety of video and audio content from a single, advanced user interface, on various
media player devices; it creates additional channels of distribution, on additional devices, for content providers;
and it provides more opportunities for device manufactures through easy integration of a variety of video and audio
content from many different providers. More information can be found at www.inetvod.com.
