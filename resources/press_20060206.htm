<p><b>iNetVOD Invites Internet-Based Video Content Providers to Utilize Their Platform to Offer Free and Fee-Based Content to TV Viewers</b><br>
<br>
Collegeville, PA, February 6, 2006/PRWEB/ -- iNetVOD, the Internet-based video-on-demand (VOD) software
company is offering it’s iNetVOD Service<font size="1">sm</font> to Internet-based video content providers
to utilize it’s platform to offer free and fee-based content to TV viewers. The iNetVOD Service<font size="1">sm</font>
will connect media player devices such as Windows Media Center Edition enabled computers and TVs and
eventually, advanced media player devices such as networked DVD players and game consoles, to communicate
directly with Internet-based VOD content providers through the computer or TV. This enables viewers to locate
and access Internet-based VOD content from the comfort of their living rooms by simply using their television
remotes.<br>
<br>
"iNetVOD has developed an open marketplace for delivery of Internet-based VOD content. Utilizing the iNetVOD
menu of available content, TV viewers will be able to easily search, locate and order the content of their
choice directly from content providers. iNetVOD invites all Internet-based content providers to contact us
at our website to find out more information and learn how to expand their distribution. It is very important
to iNetVOD that content providers continue to have a direct relationship with their customer base and view
iNetVOD as another viable distribution channel," said Larry Fyock, CEO of iNetVOD.<br>
<br>
iNetVOD also has ongoing discussions with many network enabled media player device manufacturers that make
networked DVD players, game consoles and other devices. Once completed, these devices will house iNetVOD’s
software to enable delivery of the Internet-based content.<br>
<br>
About iNetVOD<br>
iNetVOD provides a video-on-demand open marketplace service for bringing together Internet-based VOD content
providers with network-enabled consumer electronic and media player devices that are attached to consumers'
television sets. This would include devices such as networked DVD players, specialized media player devices,
gaming consoles, set-top boxes, personal computers, etc. iNetVOD does not provide its own video-on-demand
content nor does it build or manufacture its own media player device. Instead, iNetVOD has created an open
standard for connecting these existing media player devices with Internet-based video content. This integration
helps consumers locate and access Internet-based VOD content using their television remotes. More information
can be found at www.inetvod.com.
